; GOAL: Design and implement an Adjacency list representation of graphs and an Adjacency matrix representation
; of graphs using adbstract data types. 

; DEFINITION OF GRAPH: A Graph 'G' is a non-linear data structure composed of a set of 'vertices' (V)
; and a set of 'edges' (E). The Graph G is denoted as G(V, E), V being the number of vertices and 
; E being the number of Edges.  

; This information suggests that we will need data type for sets, vertices (V) and edges (E)

; To help us in the process of creating data types for sets, vertices, edges and various 
; implementations of graphs, it would be beneficial to think about the various computations
; one would want to carry on such data types.
