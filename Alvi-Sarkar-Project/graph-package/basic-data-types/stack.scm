; ---- ABSTRACT ----
; We know that a Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LAST IN FIRST OUT (LIFO) principle, 
; meaning that the last element that is added to a Stack would be the first element that would be removed 
; from the stack. 

; The insertion of an element and the removal of an element within a Stack is defined through two main 
; operations:

; Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack
; Pop: Removes and returns the topmost element of the stack

; In the context of graphs, the Stack data type could be used in various search/traversal algorthms. 
; One such application of the stack data type would be DFS or the Depth-First Search algorithm. 
; The DFS algorithm does this by visiting a vertex of the graph and recursively visiting its 
; adjacent vertices.
