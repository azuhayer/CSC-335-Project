; ----- ABSTRACT -----
; A graph in computer programming represents a collection of interconnected nodes or commonly known as
; vertices, along with edges that connect these vertices together. 

; There are different types of graph data structures, some of which include: directed graphs
; (where edges have a specific direction), undirected graphs (where edges have no direction), and lastly
; weighted graphs (where edges have 'weights' or assigned values to them). 

; Along with these different graph data structures, there are also various ways to implement a graph 
; data type. Two such implementations are: the adjacency list representation, and the adjacency matrix 
; representation.  

;  We will be implementing both representations here.
